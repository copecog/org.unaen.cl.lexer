;;;;   This is intended as a most literal implementation according to the
;;;; mathematical definition of finite automata used by lexers.

;;;;   The plan is to make something that takes a sort of expression mapping
;;;; directly to piece-wise construction of regular expression NFAs (since
;;;; regular expression grammar itself is context-free), and then convert the
;;;; NFA to a DFA, and the DFA to a generated function that can be used as a
;;;; scanner.

;;;;   After I complete this, I want to write a parser for context free
;;;; grammars that couples with this scanner so that I can generate
;;;; scanner/lexer functions for regular expressions and perl-style regular
;;;; expressions.
